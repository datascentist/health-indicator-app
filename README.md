Heart and Diabetes Prediction Tool
Project Description
This tool uses machine learning to predict the likelihood of heart disease and diabetes based on user inputs. It also provides personalized health improvement tips to help users make informed lifestyle choices. The backend is powered by Django, while the frontend is built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Features
User Input Form: Users input their health data (e.g., age, blood pressure, etc.).
Prediction Engine: Uses machine learning models to predict the likelihood of heart disease and diabetes.
Health Improvement Tips: Personalized tips based on the user’s health data.

Technologies Used
Backend: Django (Python)
Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
Machine Learning: scikit-learn
Database: Sqlitedb for storing user data and results.
Version Control: Git (GitHub)

Getting Started
Prerequisites
To get started, you'll need the following software installed on your machine:

Python 3.8 or newer
pip (Python package installer)
Django
scikit-learn

Installation
Clone the Repository

bash

Run the Server Start the Django development server:

bash
Copy code
python manage.py runserver
Access the Tool Open a web browser and navigate to http://localhost:8000 to start using the tool.

Usage
Go to the homepage where you will find diabetes and heart links click on one of them and you will find a form to input your health data.

Submit your data, and the tool will generate predictions based on your inputs.
View your prediction results and personalized health improvement tips.

Machine Learning Model
Model Overview
The model used in this project are [logistic regression for Heart Dataset, Random Forest Classifier for Diabetes Dataset]. It is trained on a dataset that contains features such as age, blood pressure, glucose levels, etc., to predict the likelihood of heart disease and diabetes.
